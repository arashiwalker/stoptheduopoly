                      <b>Entrenched Democrats & Republicans Benefiting from the Hyperinflationary Growth of Money in Politics</b><br><br>

                      The explosive growth of money in politics since the 1980s has grossly distorted the Elections' Process. Hyperinflation is the bane of all country's economies. In the USA, it's not oil or food or wages or health care where costs are exploding, rather, it is ONLY in our political economy. The rate of inflation in campaign spending dwarfs inflation rates in any other sector of our economy. <br><br>

                      <b>The Losers are many:</b> We the People first & foremost, followed by our country, communities & governmental institutions. Yet, there is one clear winner: the entrenched Democrat & Republican parties. This Demublican Duopoly is the two-faced funnel that all the cash courses through. When Supreme Court rulings favor money, Team Red/Blue says thank you very much. I'll have another dollop of campaign cash. More money guarantees Red/Blue entrenchment at the expense of a healthy democracy & a thriving unfettered economy.

                      Members of both House of Congress duty is to represent the diverse voices of the electorate in their individual Districts & States. It is not their duty to represent the voices of those who carry & distribute money in Washington DC. As it stands now, Republican & Democrat incumbents get the gross majority of their money donations from within 'the beltway' which is the insiders term for greater Washington DC.<br><br>

                      This practice is very, very unhealthy for our representative democracy. It corrodes the entire process, but expecting derelict Republicans & Democrats to put an end to representing DC $$$ is like asking an out of control alcoholic to just get by and have a few more drinks. A law need not be passed that would forbid party members while in office from collecting DC cash to pay for their campaigns. Such a law would be unconstitutional and unnecessary.<br><br>

                      <b>The Humaucracy Political Reform Plan calls on Members of Congress to make a pledge, similar to the 'Pledge of Allegiance,' we all say in school:</b><br><br>

                      Congressmen/woman pledge NOT to solicit, accept or contribute cash for any political purpose from any individual or organization within the 100-mile Washington DC Political Cash Free Zone. The only civic location for US Representatives & Senators to solicit campaign contributions is from voters living within their respective States & US House Districts.

All the money contained within these PACs would be returned to the Treasury to be used to pay down the deficit.  Without Leadership PACs, congress members would be forced to turn to their loyalty to the electorate, not campaign cash kings!</b><br><br>


                      You've likely heard of Super PACs (Political Action Committees). These are the ubiquitous special interest $$$ political organizations that flood our local elections with 'Outside Money.' These are the usual suspects in channeling money to both Democrat & Republican causes & campaigns. They contribute greatly to political finance hyperinflation and give special interest $$$ an outsize voice in our democracy<br><br>

                      On the other hand, a Leadership PAC, is a personal political money cache that is dedicated specifically to individual Senators & Representatives. These personal Leadership PACS didn't exist before 1980. They were created specifically to get around the restrictions placed on fundraising politicians in the wake of Watergate. Personal Leadership PACs allow long serving, incumbent Republican & Democrat members of Congress enrich themselves, their families & friends. It allows the Democrats & Republicans create nepotistic political dynasties at the expense of the American people.<br><br>

                      Over the decades, members of both parties adopted personal Leadership PACs as a way to cash in on their office, pass the benefits & six figure campaign jobs to friends, family members or other special interests. Today, nearly every Republican & Democrat member of Congress has a personal Leadership PAC. Up until 35 years ago no members needed such cash hoards. They are not needed now.

                        <b>What is Gerrymandering?</b>

                        Gerrymandering is the single most important tool Democrats & Republicans use to disenfranchise general citizens. To gerrymander is to draw the boundaries of the electoral maps of each State to ensure that members of that party win. The result is that if a voter lives in a Red State, the legislature/governor of that state draws the electoral map to ensure that Republicans win. Or, like in Oregon, a Blue State, the maps are drawn to ensure that Democrat party candidates win. In both instances, citizens and our democracy lose.
